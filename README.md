# Hello there

Welcome to my project. 
# Rating System React Application

This project is a React application that lets users rate items using a star rating system and interact with a dialog box. The project is structured around components and props to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.

## What This Project Does

This React application demonstrates how to build a star rating system and a dialog box using components and props. Here's what each part of the project does:

### Star Rating System

The star rating system allows users to rate items by clicking on stars. The system consists of two main components:

- **StarRating**: This component displays five stars that users can click on to rate an item. It also shows a descriptive word based on the selected star count.

- **Star**: Represents an individual star in the rating system. When clicked, it triggers a function to update the rating.

The star icons used in the system are from the `react-icons` library.

### Dialog Box

The dialog box provides an interactive element where users can perform actions. It consists of:

- **Dialog**: Displays a box with a button. Clicking the button triggers a function (provided by the parent component) to close the dialog.
